# SIEM for Cloud Security and Compliance

## Description
This project focuses on implementing a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution to enhance cloud security and compliance monitoring. Utilizing Microsoft Sentinel, the project demonstrates how to monitor security events in a cloud-hosted virtual machine (VM) on Microsoft Azure. By leveraging the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and MITRE CALDERA, the project simulates cyberattacks to test the effectiveness of the SIEM solution in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of security events using Microsoft Sentinel.
- Integration with cloud services to ensure compliance and security.
- Simulation of cyberattacks using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and MITRE CALDERA.
- Comprehensive logging and reporting for compliance verification.
- Scalable architecture suitable for various cloud environments.

## Technologies Used
- **Cloud Platform:** Microsoft Azure
- **SIEM Tool:** Microsoft Sentinel
- **Cybersecurity Frameworks:** MITRE ATT&CK Framework, MITRE CALDERA
- **Hosting Environment:** Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
